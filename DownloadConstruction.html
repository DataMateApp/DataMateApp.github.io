Hey everyone,

I’m a retired owner’s rep and project manager from central Illinois. Over the years, I’ve developed a passion for creating practical tools to streamline data management for construction projects—whether that’s through Excel, Google Sheets, or now with Google Sheets and Excel add-ons.

Recently, I released a Google Sheets add-on, DataMateApp, designed to capture and manage data as filterable and sortable records. Now, I’m applying similar ideas to a new Excel VBA template specifically for managing complex construction data, and I’m looking for input from those of you in the field.

Here’s what the new Excel template will include:
Extensive CSI Division and Section support to allow for comprehensive project estimates
Compatibility with Excel 5.0 or later to ensure a broad range of users can access it, even on older versions
User-friendly design with no XLOOKUP formulas, making it accessible for users of all skill levels
Automated dataset creation, custom pages, and buttons for efficient, streamlined use
Right now, this template is still in development (about 40% done), but I’m aiming to make it adaptable to various construction needs. I’d love your thoughts, suggestions, and any tools or forms you’ve found useful in your work. If you’re an architect, GC, subcontractor, or vendor with Excel templates for ASIs, change orders, or other essential forms, I’d appreciate any files you’re willing to share to help shape this tool.

Feel free to send your feedback, ideas, or files to datamateapp@gmail.com, or check out the early download below.

Thanks in advance to anyone willing to contribute—together, we can create something that really benefits the community!</p>
