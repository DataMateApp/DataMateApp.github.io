        <h1>Privacy Policy for DataMateApps and AddressBlock</h1>
        <p><strong>Last updated: May 8, 2025</strong></p>
        <div class="section">
            <p>Excellence-US, LLC ("we", "us", or "our") operates DataMateApps and AddressBlock, commercial add-ons for Google Workspace. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our services. By using DataMateApps or AddressBlock, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy. We are committed to safeguarding your privacy and adhering to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including its Limited Use requirements.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Data We Collect and How We Use It</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <p>DataMateApps and AddressBlock collect and process data to provide their core functionalities, such as saving records, managing contacts, creating forms, and generating address blocks. We only collect data necessary for these purposes and for analytics to improve our services. Below is a detailed breakdown of the data we access and how it’s used:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Google Sheets Data</strong>: We access, create, edit, and delete spreadsheets to store and organize data, such as records, templates (e.g., inventory, timesheets, purchase orders), and contact lists. This enables features like saving form submissions and generating address blocks.</li>
                <li><strong>Google Drive Files</strong>: We access, create, edit, and delete files in Google Drive to store uploads (e.g., images, PDFs) and signatures collected via forms. This supports features like attaching files to records or storing form responses.</li>
                <li><strong>Gmail Emails</strong>: We read, compose, send, and delete emails to support email-related features, such as sending notifications (e.g., when a dataset or record is created), importing Gmail contacts, and drafting emails with pre-filled data (e.g., for mail merges).</li>
                <li><strong>Email Address</strong>: We access your email address to authenticate your identity and personalize email communications (e.g., sending emails from your account).</li>
                <li><strong>Form Data</strong>: We collect data entered in forms created by DataMateApps, including text, numbers, files, signatures, and geolocation, to save records or populate spreadsheets.</li>
                <li><strong>Usage Data</strong>: We collect anonymized analytics to monitor app performance and improve functionality, such as tracking feature usage or error rates.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not collect or process data beyond what is necessary for the app’s functionality or analytics. All data accessed via Google APIs is handled securely and not shared with third parties, except as described below under "Third-Party Integrations."</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Permissions We Request</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <p>DataMateApps and AddressBlock require specific permissions to function. These permissions allow us to access your Google account data as described below. Each permission is necessary for the app’s core features, and we’ve explained why we need it and why a narrower scope wouldn’t work.</p>

            <h3>DataMateApps Permissions</h3>
            <button class="collapsible">View DataMateApps Permissions</button>
            <div class="content">
                <div class="scope-details">
                    <p><strong>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify</strong>: Allows DataMateApps to read, compose, send, and delete emails in your Gmail account. We use this to import Gmail contacts for address blocks, send automated notifications (e.g., when a record is saved), and manage email drafts for features like mail merges. A narrower scope wouldn’t suffice because the app needs full email management to support these features.</p>
                    <p><strong>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.compose</strong>: Allows DataMateApps to create and modify email drafts. We use this to pre-fill emails with data from your spreadsheets or forms, enabling you to review before sending. A narrower scope wouldn’t suffice because draft creation is essential for email automation.</p>
                    <p><strong>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send</strong>: Allows DataMateApps to send emails on your behalf. We use this to send notifications (e.g., “DataMate Dataset Created”) and emails generated from your data, such as reports or confirmations. A narrower scope wouldn’t suffice because sending emails is a core feature.</p>
                    <p><strong>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly</strong>: Allows DataMateApps to read email content and metadata. We use this to extract contact information from Gmail for the AddressBlock feature and to process email data for records. A narrower scope wouldn’t suffice because read access is necessary for contact integration.</p>
                    <p><strong>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive</strong>: Allows DataMateApps to see, edit, create, and delete files in Google Drive. We use this to store form uploads (e.g., images, PDFs), signatures, and generated files, such as reports or templates. A narrower scope wouldn’t suffice because full Drive access is required for file management.</p>
                    <p><strong>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets</strong>: Allows DataMateApps to see, edit, create, and delete Google Sheets. We use this to create and manage spreadsheets for records, templates (e.g., inventory, timesheets), and contact lists. A narrower scope wouldn’t suffice because dynamic spreadsheet operations are central to the app.</p>
                    <p><strong>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.send_mail</strong>: Allows DataMateApps to send emails via Google Apps Script. We use this for automated emails, such as alerts when a dataset is created, complementing Gmail API functionality. A narrower scope wouldn’t suffice because this scope ensures reliable email delivery.</p>
                    <p><strong>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.external_request</strong>: Allows DataMateApps to connect to external services. We use this to fetch data from third-party APIs (e.g., geocoding for addresses) or integrate external content into forms and records. A narrower scope wouldn’t suffice because external connectivity enhances app functionality.</p>
                    <p><strong>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email openid</strong>: Allows DataMateApps to access your email address for authentication. We use this to verify your identity and personalize email communications. A narrower scope wouldn’t suffice because email identification is required for user authentication.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>AddressBlock Permissions</h3>
            <button class="collapsible">View AddressBlock Permissions</button>
            <div class="content">
                <div class="scope-details">
                    <p><strong>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets</strong>: Allows AddressBlock to see, edit, create, and delete Google Sheets. We use this to create and manage contact lists and address blocks in spreadsheets. A narrower scope wouldn’t suffice because spreadsheet operations are essential for generating address blocks.</p>
                    <p><strong>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.external_request</strong>: Allows AddressBlock to connect to external services. We use this to fetch address-related data (e.g., via geocoding APIs) to enhance address accuracy. A narrower scope wouldn’t suffice because external data integration is critical for the feature.</p>
                    <p><strong>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.container.ui</strong>: Allows AddressBlock to display third-party web content in prompts and sidebars. We use this to show interactive UI elements, such as contact forms or address previews, within Google Sheets. A narrower scope wouldn’t suffice because custom UI is required for user interaction.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Third-Party Integrations</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <p>DataMateApps may connect to external services via the `script.external_request` scope to enhance functionality, such as fetching geocoding data for addresses or integrating with APIs for form processing. These services are carefully selected, and we ensure they comply with data protection standards. No personal data is shared with third parties unless explicitly required for the service, and only with your consent.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <p>We do not share your personal data with any third parties, except as required for third-party integrations (as described above) or to comply with legal obligations. Data accessed via Google APIs remains within the Google ecosystem or is processed securely by our app.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <p>Data stored in your Google Sheets, Drive, or Gmail accounts remains under your control and is retained according to your Google account settings. We do not independently store or retain your data outside of your Google account. If you leave comments or reviews on our website, they are retained indefinitely unless you request deletion.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <p>We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data, including secure connections and compliance with Google’s API security requirements. However, no system is completely secure, and we encourage you to use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication on your Google account.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Your Data Rights</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <p>You have full control over your data. You can:</p>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>Delete</strong>: Request deletion of personal data, such as website comments, by contacting us. Data in your Google account can be deleted directly by you.</li>
                <li><strong>Revoke Permissions</strong>: Revoke our app’s access to your Google account via your Google Account settings.</li>
            </ul>
