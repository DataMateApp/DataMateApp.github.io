        <h1>Privacy Policy for DataMateApps and AddressBlock</h1>
        <p><strong>Last updated: June 10, 2025</strong></p>
        <div class="section">
            <p>Excellence-US, LLC ("we", "us", or "our") operates DataMateApps and AddressBlock, commercial add-ons for Google Workspace. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our services. By using DataMateApps or AddressBlock, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy. We are committed to safeguarding your privacy and adhering to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including its Limited Use requirements.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Data We Collect and How We Use It</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <p>DataMateApps and AddressBlock collect and process data to provide their core functionalities, such as saving records, managing contacts, creating forms, and generating address blocks. We also collect limited data for analytics to monitor usage and improve our services. Below is a detailed breakdown of the data we access and how it’s used:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Google Sheets Data</strong>: We access, create, edit, and delete spreadsheets to store and organize data, such as records, templates (e.g., inventory, timesheets, purchase orders), contact lists, and usage counters. This enables features like saving form submissions, generating address blocks, and tracking dataset and record creation.</li>
                <li><strong>Google Drive Files</strong>: (Only used in open-source code for UploadFile and Signature form fields when deployed as web app.) We access, create, edit, and delete files in Google Drive to store uploads (e.g., images, PDFs) and signatures collected via forms. This supports features like attaching files to records or storing form responses.</li>
                <li><strong>Gmail Emails</strong>: We read, compose, send, and delete emails to support email-related features, such as sending notifications (e.g., when a dataset or record is created), importing Gmail contacts, and drafting emails with pre-filled data (e.g., for mail merges). We also send notification emails to <strong>projectprodigyapp@gmail.com</strong>, a service email address managed by Excellence-US, LLC, to track the number of datasets created and records saved. These emails appear in your sent mail folder and are processed to extract your email address for usage tracking.</li>
                <li><strong>Email Address</strong>: To send notifications to <strong>projectprodigyapp@gmail.com</strong> (e.g., “DataMate Record Created”). We access your email address to authenticate your identity, personalize email communications, and track usage. Specifically, when notification emails are sent to <strong>projectprodigyapp@gmail.com</strong>, we extract your email address and store it in Google Sheets (e.g., in "NewContact" and "contacts" sheets) to monitor dataset and record creation and associate usage with your account.</li>
                <li><strong>Contact Data</strong>: If you provide contact information (e.g., name, address) via forms or import it from Gmail, we store this data in Google Sheets (e.g., "contacts" sheet) to support features like address block generation and contact management.</li>
                <li><strong>Form Data</strong>: We collect data entered in forms created by DataMateApps, including text, numbers, files, signatures, and geolocation, to save records or populate spreadsheets.</li>
                <li><strong>Usage Data</strong>: We collect anonymized analytics to monitor app performance and improve functionality, such as tracking feature usage or error rates. Additionally, we track the number of datasets created and records saved, associated with your email address, to analyze usage patterns and enhance our services.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not collect or process data beyond what is necessary for the app’s functionality or analytics. All data accessed via Google APIs is handled securely. Notification emails sent to <strong>projectprodigyapp@gmail.com</strong> are used solely for usage tracking and are not shared with third parties beyond Excellence-US, LLC.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Permissions We Request</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <p>DataMateApps and AddressBlock require specific permissions to function. These permissions allow us to access your Google account data as described below. Each permission is necessary for the app’s core features, and we’ve explained why we need it and why a narrower scope wouldn’t work.</p>

            <h3>DataMateApps Permissions</h3>
<button class="collapsible">View DataMateApps Permissions</button>
<div class="content">
    <div class="scope-details">
        <p><strong>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets</strong>: Allows DataMateApps to see, edit, create, and delete Google Sheets. We use this to create and manage spreadsheets for records, templates (e.g., inventory, timesheets), contact lists, and usage counters. A narrower scope wouldn’t suffice because dynamic spreadsheet operations are central to the app.</p>
        <p><strong>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive</strong>: (Only used in open-source code for UploadFile and Signature form fields when deployed as web app.) Allows DataMateApps to see, edit, create, and delete files in Google Drive. We use this to store form uploads (e.g., images, PDFs), signatures, and generated files, such as reports or templates. A narrower scope wouldn’t suffice because full Drive access is required for file management.</p>
        <p><strong>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.container.ui</strong>: Allows DataMateApps to display third-party web content in prompts, dialogs, and sidebars within Google Sheets. We use this to show interactive UI elements, such as form previews, contact forms, or sidebars for data entry. A narrower scope wouldn’t suffice because custom UI is required for user interaction.</p>
        <p><strong>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.send_mail</strong>: To send notifications to send emails via Google Apps Script when a form is submitted. A narrower scope wouldn’t suffice because this scope ensures reliable email delivery.</p>
        <p><strong>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send</strong>: This scope is essential for the core functionality of DataMateApps, specifically the "Mail It" feature, which enables users to send emails directly from a Google Spreadsheet. This feature allows users to select a range of spreadsheet data, format it as an HTML table, and send it as an email to recipients listed in a "contacts" sheet (Column P for email addresses, Column A for names). The emails are sent using the GmailApp.sendEmail method in Google Apps Script, which constructs and sends HTML-formatted emails based on user inputs from a sidebar interface.</p>
        <p><strong>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.external_request</strong>: Allows AddressBlock to connect to external services. We use this to fetch address-related data (e.g., via geocoding APIs) to enhance address accuracy. A narrower scope wouldn’t suffice because external data integration is critical for the feature.</p>


    </div>
</div>
        <h2>Third-Party Integrations</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <p>DataMateApps may connect to external services via the <code>script.external_request</code> scope to enhance functionality, such as fetching geocoding data for addresses or integrating with APIs for form processing. These services are carefully selected, and we ensure they comply with data protection standards. No personal data is shared with third parties unless explicitly required for the service, and only with your consent. The notification emails sent to <strong>projectprodigyapp@gmail.com</strong> are managed by Excellence-US, LLC and are not shared with third parties.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <p>We do not share your personal data with third parties, except as described below:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Usage Tracking</strong>: When you create a dataset or save a record, DataMateApps sends a notification email to <strong>projectprodigyapp@gmail.com</strong>, a service email address managed by Excellence-US, LLC. These emails include your email address, which we extract and store in Google Sheets to track usage (e.g., number of datasets created or records saved). This data is used solely for analytics and service improvement and is not shared with any external parties.</li>
                <li><strong>Third-Party Integrations</strong>: As described above, some features may involve external services, but no personal data is shared without your consent.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal Obligations</strong>: We may share data to comply with legal requirements, such as responding to lawful requests from authorities.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All other data accessed via Google APIs remains within the Google ecosystem or is processed securely by our app.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <p>Data stored in your Google Sheets, Drive, or Gmail accounts remains under your control and is retained according to your Google account settings. Specifically:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Usage Data</strong>: Your email address and associated usage data (e.g., dataset and record counts) stored in Google Sheets (e.g., "NewContact" and "contacts" sheets) are retained for as long as necessary to support analytics and service improvement, typically until you revoke our app’s access or delete the relevant spreadsheets.</li>
                <li><strong>Notification Emails</strong>: Emails sent to <strong>projectprodigyapp@gmail.com</strong> are retained by Excellence-US, LLC for usage tracking purposes and deleted periodically when no longer needed for analytics.</li>
                <li><strong>Comments and Reviews</strong>: If you leave comments or reviews on our website, they are retained indefinitely unless you request deletion.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can delete data in your Google account at any time or request deletion of data we hold (e.g., website comments) by contacting us.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <p>We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data, including secure connections and compliance with Google’s API security requirements. However, no system is completely secure, and we encourage you to use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication on your Google account.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Your Data Rights</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <p>You have full control over your data. You can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Access</strong>: View data stored in your Google Sheets, Drive, or Gmail accounts at any time.</li>
                <li><strong>Export</strong>: Request an exported file of personal data we hold, such as comments or reviews left on our website.</li>
                <li><strong>Delete</strong>: Request deletion of personal data, such as website comments, by contacting us. Data in your Google account can be deleted directly by you.</li>
                <li><strong>Revoke Permissions</strong>: Revoke our app’s access to your Google account via your Google Account settings.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To exercise these rights, contact us at the link below. We will respond within 30 days. Note that we may retain certain data for legal or administrative purposes, as required by law.</p>
